## How to Use
Local setup:
- Register for an account on the **Register page**.   
- Then, login with your credentials on the **Login page**.  
- Go to the **Portfolio page** and enter a ticket symbol to purchase stock shares - every account begins with $5000.

## Running Locally
Front-end:
- Run `npm start` while in the root directory of the front-end app, ie. (stock-portfolio/front-end). It should run on https://localhost:3000.

Back-end:
- The back-end was made with Node.js and Express with the help of MongoDB.  
- To run this locally, run `nodemon index.js` or `node index.js` while in the root directory of the app, ie. (stock-portfolio). It should run on http://localhost:3500.
