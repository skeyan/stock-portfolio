# Stockfolio
A full-stack app where a user can login, buy, and manage stocks.

## How to Use
Register for an account on the Register page. 
Then, login with your credentials on the Login page.
Go to the Portfolio page and enter a valid ticket symbol to purchase stock shares - every account begins with $5000.
Monitor your stocks on the Portfolio page, or go to your Transactions page to see your purchase history.
Logout and log back in at any time!

## Running Locally
The back-end was made with Node.js and Express with the help of MongoDB.
The back-end is deployed at: https://stockfolio-back-end.herokuapp.com/

To run this locally, run `nodemon index.js` on the root directory! 
It should run on localhost:5000.
