# Stockfolio: Front-end

The front-end of Stockfolio uses React.js and Redux.js.
The front-end is deployed at: https://stockfolio-app-back.herokuapp.com/.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In order to run this locally, ensure that the "start" line in `package.json`'s scripts is `"start": "react-scripts start"`. 

Then, run `npm start`!
