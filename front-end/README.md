# Stockfolio: Front-end

The front-end of Stockfolio uses React.js and Redux.js.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In order to run this locally, change the line `"start": "serve -s build",` in `package.json`'s scripts to `"start": "react-scripts start"`. Then, run `npm start`!
